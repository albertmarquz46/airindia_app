    <h1>FootBall Introduction</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>
     Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
     kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football
     generally means the form of football that is the most popular
     where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include
     association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada,
     South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland 
     and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football;
     gridiron football (specifically American football, arena
     football, or Canadian football); International rules football;
     rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These
     various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common
     origins and are known as "football codes".
